# how-to-guides

# Purpose 
The idea of this repo is to provide guides of things I've learned along the way in both my profresional life *(Networking/security)* and my personal hobbies (archlinux/python/rust) to help anyone who wants to learn some stuff I've picked up a long the way. 

## Will add more to this later.
